The refund by location smart contract is aimed to be used when one party or an employer, agrees to pay another party or an employee, for being present in a certain geographic area for a certain duration. The employeeâ€™s phone sends its GPS location to a smart contract at a certain interval. Based on the pre-agreed contract codified in an Ethereum smart contract, a cryptocurrency payment is executed when all the agreed conditions are met.
